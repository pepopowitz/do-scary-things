Notes:

What do we fear?

luckily for us, someone does a survey

Notes:

Chapman University in California does an annual survey of fears amongst Americans.

And there's a lot of fears in there that many of us sympathize with.

...

but it's impersonal.

I want to get more personal.

starting with some PRIMAL fears

Notes:

I have some more long-term fears, too

like a fear of getting old

about schmidt - early 2000s

Jack Nicholson plays a retiree who finds himself **more and more alone**

as he gets older

...

When I watched this movie, my stomach hurt so bad from fear,

I wanted to curl into a ball the whole time.

And I don't think it was until I saw this movie that I realized how much I feared getting old.

Notes:

i fear that I'm not good enough for my wife.

She'll get sick of my **emotional immaturity**

and leave me

...

This fear is really about **relationships**

and I think I'm not alone in fearing that I'm going to mess up a relationship.

...

some people fear

- being in them
- not being in them
- messing them up
- raising kids poorly

Notes:

and work. Who has fears about work?

Who _doesn't_ have fears about work?

- I get incredible anxiety over sending a calendar invite to more than 2 people.
- taking a job you'll regret
- asking for a raise - uncomfortable conversations
- telling my boss how I really feel - afraid I'll get fired
- take ownership of a feature/project/system - afraid of the commitment

Notes:

i fear self-promotion

i fear being rejected as being **too braggy**

or being found out that I'm **not worth self-promoting**

I did a whole lot of it at the beginning of this talk, and _it was excruciating_.

I went back and forth on pulling those slides out 25 times.

Notes:

many fear public speaking

you might have heard that people fear it more than death

According to the Chapman research, **not true**.

27.9% for death, 26% for public speaking

...

and these fears, and many like them, are all kind of the **same basic fear**

Notes:

the fear of rejection

these fears of rejection are what i'm really interested in today

because these are the fears that prevent us from doing great things with our career

from deciding to **publish a blog**

or a **book**

or **start speaking**

or take on a **new role or responsibilities** that we think are really neat

but are too scared of

or **quitting our job and going freelance**

Notes:

On a personal level, overcoming these kinds of fears are the best move I've made in my career

It got me speaking across the Midwest, into Canada, and here today in front of you as a keynote speaker

And that got me my current job - my friend Jon from Artsy came to one of my talks

I'm hopeful that helping you overcome your fears can change your life like it's changed mine.

# \* **I am not a doctor.**

Notes:

A really quick disclaimer:

I am not a professional psychologist, and I am making shit up.

The "fear" I'm talking about today is not the kind of fear based on terrifying life events,

that leaves you curled up in a ball in a corner or unable to function.

I don't have any ability to discuss, diagnose, or treat that level of fear.

I _do_ have the ability to support you and assist you in finding help - so if that describes you, and you _want_ help, I'll help you get in contact with someone. See me later.

For this talk, I'm speaking about the kinds of fears that hinder you from being the best version of you.
