# Why Do We Fear?

Notes:

Over-simplified, the popular science looks like this:

Footer: false

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/brain-fear-1.jpg" -->

Notes:

There is a group of structures in our brain

that form the "limbic system".

this system is involved in many of our **emotions and motivations**

especially those **related to survival.**

Like **fear, anger, memory,** and emotions related to **reproduction.**

---

Footer: false

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/brain-fear-2.jpg" -->

Notes:

And the limbic system has many functions, but one of its main functions,

is to **take sensory inputs**...

---

Footer: false

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/brain-fear-3.jpg" -->

Notes:

and send them to be **triaged** in the prefrontal cortex.

The prefrontal cortex is a newer part of the brain - **more evolved**.

It does a pretty solid job of **identifying threats (or non-threats)**

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/brain-fear-4.jpg" -->

Notes:

and then it can **trigger** an appropriate physical **response.**

...

BUT...

The PFC is SLOW.

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/tiger.jpg" -->

Notes:

And sometimes we don't have a lot of time to process threats

So, the limbic system...

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/brain-fear-5.jpg" -->

Notes:

Has the security clearance to make snap judgments

And provoke the body into a response

without involving the smarter, slower, PFC

This is often where you feel fight or flight

Trail: Why Do We Fear?

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/pizza.jpg" -->

Notes:

It's sort of like how every time I put a pizza in the oven, the smoke alarm in my hallway goes off.

I know it's not a fire. But the smoke alarm, my limbic system, responds quicker than I (or my PFC) can.

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/brain-fear-5.jpg" -->

Notes:

This system is great!

It's like legacy code -

it has helped our species survive, and it works, so just nobody touch it.

...

We are **born with** this system

and the **ability to fear things**

But current studies seem to indicate...

---

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/no-fear.jpg" -->

Notes:

we aren't actually born with any fears

we MIGHT be born with the fear of **loud sounds**

but even that is **up for debate**

we also develop a fear of **falling** pretty early, but that doesn't appear to be at birth

the majority, if not all, of our **fears are learned**.

---

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/spider.jpg" -->

Notes:

we seem to be **predisposed** to learn some fears

the **primal ones**

snakes & spiders, especially.

...

But most of our fears we learn by association

---

Footer: false

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/brain-fear-5.jpg" -->

Notes:

The limbic system that gets to make snap judgments on inputs -

It does so with simple pattern matching.

If it looks like something we associate with a threat,

It gets categorized as something worth fearing.

---

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/dog.jpg" -->

Notes:

It might be that **we have an experience**, and associate sharp teeth with something we should fear

Or it might be **our parents act fearful** around sharp pointy dog teeth, because they've been bitten, and we associate sharp pointy dog teeth with our parents fear

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/lila.jpg" -->

Notes:

This explains why my oldest daughter,

who has never had a bad experience with a dog,

**climbed me like a tree** a couple years ago, shrieking, when a dog came running up to her.

[Explain why].

---

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/snowball.jpg" -->

Notes:

This pattern matching is also why once you develop a fear of something,

It grows worse over time

The pattern matching continues to associate this thing with a threat

Even if it never really was one.

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/olivia-1.jpg" -->

Notes:

There's no guarantee you'll learn a fear by association

For example, I mentioned that I am terrified of snakes....

my youngest daughter, Olivia, is absolutely _not_ afraid of snakes.

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/alone.jpg" -->

Notes:

That's some science behind fear.

Let's explore what we _feel_ when we fear something.

These fears that I'm interested in - of **rejection**

They come from a few emotional places.

---

# We are concerned how **others perceive us**

Notes:

We don't want them to see us as unlike them

Notes:

Tim Urban, of the website waitbutwhy.com:

Has an amazing article about what he calls "the Social Survival Mammoth"

that **bullies us into fearing even an ounce of rejection**.

The science behind the mammoth, Tim argues, is that thousands of years ago, when we lived in caves, being rejected meant **being pushed out of the cave** and sleeping with the saber toothed tigers.

Our **biology hasn't evolved** as quickly as our **civilizations have**...and so we're stuck with this fear, this mammoth that's been hanging around for far too long, and doesn't make much sense anymore.

...

From my research I **don't think this is a fear we are born with**...but I think it is probably one that we are extremely **susceptible to**, and it doesn't take much for us to learn it.

...

In the end, Tim's post aims to **help us realize one really important thing**:

another thing that happens with fear:

---

# We see others succeed

## **and compare ourselves to them**

Notes:

This isn't helpful,

and in fact it's a major cause of **Imposter Syndrome**

And really, **it's untrue**,

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/success-1.jpg" -->

Notes:

because **we see their path** to success looking like this

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/success-2.jpg" -->

Notes:

when **in reality it looks just like ours** - like this.

...

and all those twists and turns

---

# We see ourselves **failing**

Notes:

are where we see ourselves failing.

This effect is magnified in the social media era

Facebook, Twitter, etc

are causing **damaging psychological effects**

because of this nature to compare ourselves

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/outcomes-1.png" data-background-size="80%"  -->

Notes:

Humans are really good at **seeing the negative possibilities.**

(In the **tech industry**, we are **extremely good**.)

If we look at the possible **range of outcomes** in a situation, there's a whole bunch of good ones, and a whole bunch of bad ones

...

we'll focus on the worst ones.

we might look at **one or two of the good ones**, but mostly we focus on the really awful ones.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/outcomes-2.png" data-background-size="80%" -->

Notes:

so if we are offered a choice between two options -

one in which the range of outcomes look like this,

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/outcomes-3.png" data-background-size="80%" -->

Notes:

and one in which the range of outcomes look like this,

which one do you think we take?

We take the one with the **high floor but low ceiling**

because it has the **least scary negative** outcomes.

Even though this other option clearly has the most amazing outcomes for us.

...

This risk avoidance works great when the risks are realistic

But our brain tells us stories, and very often those stories are unfounded lies.
