# Why Do We Fear?

Notes:

Over-simplified, the popular science looks like this:
---

# Limbic system

TODO: image of limbic system

Notes:

looks like this.

There is a group of structures in our brain

that form the "limbic system".

this system is involved in many of our **emotions and motivations**

especially those **related to survival.**

Like **fear, anger,** and emotions related to **reproduction.**

---

# Limbic system

TODO: image of limbic system processing

Notes:

And the limbic system has many functions, but one of its main functions,

is to **take sensory inputs**

and send them to be **triaged**

so that **threats can be identified**

and then **trigger** an appropriate physical **response.**

---

TODO: image of danger

Notes:

if we see something dangerous,

our limbic system does some pattern matching,

says "bweep bweep bweep"

and we run, before we even realize what's happening.

...

So there's **great value** in the limbic system

and in our fears

TODO: image of cookies

Notes:

There's other values to fear, too

like what I like to call the **salty/sweet principle**

have you ever forgotten to add salt to chocolate chip cookies?

it doesn't taste right.

but you add a little bit of salt - not much

and your cookies actually taste sweeter, not saltier.

...

similarly, **if we didn't have fear**...

we wouldn't have those **contrasting feelings of overcoming** fear

which feel really amazing.

# Limbic System

TODO: image of limbic system

Notes:

So we are **born with** this limbic system

and the **ability to fear things**

But current studies seem to indicate...

---

TODO: image of lack of fear

Notes:

we aren't actually born with any fears

we MIGHT be born with the fear of **loud sounds**

but even that is **up for debate**

we also develop a fear of **falling** pretty early, but that doesn't appear to be at birth

the majority, if not all, of our **fears are learned**.

---

TODO: image of spider

Notes:

we seem to be **predisposed** to learn some fears

the **primal ones**

snakes & spiders, especially

the rest....

---

TODO: image of dog

Notes:

we learn by association.

It might be that **we have an experience**, and associate sharp teeth with something we should fear

Or it might be **our parents act fearful** around sharp pointy dog teeth, because they've been bitten, and we associate sharp pointy dog teeth with our parents fear

TODO: image of Lila

Notes:

This explains why my oldest daughter,

who has never had a bad experience with a dog,

**climbed me like a tree** a couple years ago, shrieking, when a dog came running up to her.

[Explain why].

---

TODO: image of Olivia with snakes

Notes:

There's no guarantee you'll learn a fear by association

For example, I mentioned that I am terrified of snakes....

my youngest daughter, Olivia, is absolutely _not_ afraid of snakes.

---

TODO: zoom of Olivia with snakes

Notes:

...as you can see if we zoom and enhance this photo

[explain situation]

TODO: image of system failing

Notes:

so as you can see, sometimes the **system fails.**

we can **impart fears** on our children unintentionally.

...

there's also something called...

# Amygdala Hijack

Notes:

---

TODO: image of emotional intelligence book

Notes:

this term comes from the book Emotional Intelligence

by Daniel Goleman

---

# Amygdala

TODO: image of amygdala

Notes:

The structure at the center of your fight or flight reactions

is called the amygdala

(you might have heard it's responsible for fear, but it's only part of a system.)

It is basically like the **smoke alarm** in our brain.

It's one of the **first things to be notified** by our senses when we perceive external stimuli

This is basically what has **allowed us to survive** as a species.

---

Trail: Amygdala

# The Happy Path

TODO: image of happy path (including added sequence numbers)

Notes:

when everything is working correctly,

the amygdala can get the inputs and send them to the smarter parts of your brain

to figure out if they are a threat or not.

---

Trail: Amygdala

# The Hijack

TODO: image of hijack

Notes:

but sometimes there isn't enough time to wait for an official assessment.

and so the amygdala sends out a **panic alarm**

before your prefontal cortex can evaluate the threat and say "whoa - not a big deal."

---

TODO: image of pizza burning

Notes:

It's sort of like how every time I put a pizza in the oven, the smoke alarm in my hallway goes off.

I know it's not a fire. But the smoke alarm, aka amygdala, responds quicker than I (or my prefontal cortex) can.

---

TODO: image of lizard

Notes:

And in fact, the amygdala is so simplistic, that it's often referred to as **the lizard brain**

It's a part of our brain that evolved a long time ago, when we were lizards,

and our only primal concerns were **surviving, reproducing, and not much else.**

Author **Seth Godin** has a video where he talks about quieting your lizard brain.

---

TODO: image of fear as an emotion

Notes:

That's the science behind fear.

Let's look more from the emotional side.

These fears that I'm interested in - of **rejection**

They come from a few emotional places.

---

# We are concerned how **others perceive us**

Notes:

We don't them to see us as unlike them

[waitbutwhy.com/???](waitbutwhy.com/???)

Notes:

Tim Urban, of the website waitbutwhy.com:

Has an amazing article about what he calls "the Social Survival Mammoth"

that **bullies us into fearing even an ounce of rejection**.

The science behind the mammoth, Tim argues, is that thousands of years ago, when we lived in caves, being rejected meant **being pushed out of the cave** and sleeping with the saber toothed tigers.

Our **biology hasn't evolved** as quickly as our **civilizations have**...and so we're stuck with this fear, which doesn't make much sense anymore.

...

From my research I **don't think this is a fear we are born with**...but I think it is probably one that we are extremely **susceptible to**, and it doesn't take much for us to learn it.

...

In the end, Tim's post aims to **help us realize one really important thing**:

---

> Almost nothing youâ€™re socially scared of is actually scary.

Notes:

...

another thing that happens with fear:

---

# We see others succeed

## **and compare ourselves to them**

Notes:

This isn't helpful,

and in fact it's a major cause of **Imposter Syndrome**

And really, **it's untrue**,

---

TODO: image of their easy path

Notes:

because **we see their path** to success looking like this

---

TODO: image of our hard path

Notes:

when **in reality it looks just like ours** - like this.

...

and all those twists and turns

---

# We see ourselves **failing**

Notes:

are where we see ourselves failing.

This effect is magnified in the social media era

Facebook, Twitter, etc

are causing **damaging psychological effects**

because of this nature to compare ourselves

---

TODO: image of possible outcomes

Notes:

Humans are really good at **seeing the negative possibilities.**

(In the **tech industry**, we are **extremely good**.)

If we look at the possible **range of outcomes** in a situation, there's a whole bunch of good ones, and a whole bunch of bad ones

...

we'll focus on the worst ones.

we might look at **one or two of the good ones**, but mostly we focus on the really awful ones.

---

TODO: image of low ceiling, high floor

Notes:

so if we are offered a choice between two options -

one in which the range of outcomes look like this,

---

TODO: image of high ceiling, low floor

Notes:

and one in which the range of outcomes look like this,

which one do you think we take?

We take the one with the **high floor but low ceiling**

because it has the **least scary negative** outcomes.

Even though this other option clearly has the most amazing outcomes for us.

...

Our brain tells us stories, and very often those stories are unfounded lies.
