Notes:

We live in an amazing time.

Thanks to tech startups, failure is fully embraced right now.

Notes:

what you _don't_ see are these

all the other attempts they've made on the road to their greatest successes

They've been laying seeds for a long time

That's what it takes.

Cultivating a garden - the harvest doesn't come immediately; it comes with persistence, consistency, definitely some luck, and a lot of work.
