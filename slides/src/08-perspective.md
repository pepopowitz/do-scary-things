# Embrace Failure

Notes:

We live in an amazing time.

Thanks to tech startups, failure is fully embraced right now.

That was definitely not the case when we were kids.

But today, they _teach_ this in schools

My kids' classrooms have signs all over endorsing a growth mindset

This is great!

Chris Turner

Notes:

This is one that I like better

From a former coworker.

In regards to snowboarding but so much more.

> You really are pushing yourself if you do something and it goes horrible.

Aziz Ansari

Notes:

about working on his comedy at seedy comedy clubs

"If I'm just killing all the time, I'm just worried too much about having a good time and doing a good show in that moment.

If I do a set where I just completely tank, that means I really went for something and tried something difficult.

...

let's embrace failure as a means to learn

and get better

and when you _do_ fail...

# Forgive Yourself

Notes:

Treat yourself as you would treat a friend

If your best friend tries something amazing

and doesn't get the outcome they wanted

Do you beat them up for failing?

You don't. And you shouldn't do it to yourself, either.

Notes:

We spend so much time comparing ourselves to others

and when we see someone successful, this is what we see:

their greatest successes

Trail: Perspective

TODO: image of saplings around a tree

Notes:

what you _don't_ see are these

all the other attempts they've made on the road to their greatest successes

They've been laying seeds for a long time

That's what it takes.

Cultivating a garden - the harvest doesn't come immediately; it comes with persistence, consistency, and just doing the work.
