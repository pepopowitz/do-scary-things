# Problem Solving

Notes:

The next group is Problem Solving.

Which, as developers, we are really good at.

And I recommend a simple approach to solving big, scary problems:

Trail: Problem Solving

## **1. Identify The Crux**

Notes:

In climbing, there is the notion of "the crux" on every route.

...

And this is pretty similar to the approach DDEisenhower used to manage his time.

Notes:

Identify the most scary thing....
Then eat the frog.
Then the next....

...

And what we're really doing...

is the same thing we do every day as developers.

Breaking a problem down into smaller problems.
