Notes:

1 - Prepare yourself for the challenge of doing something scary

2 - Practice overcoming fears and rejection, so that it becomes easier

3 - Maintain a strong mindful and physical presence

4 - Use the problem solving skills you already possess to break problems down

5 - Maintain perspective - failure is great if it's used for learning and growing.

Notes:

I'm going to close with one more story about climbing.

story

I thought about it long after, as more profound than it immediately seemed

We tell ourselves lies

We make ourselves believe stories about ourselves that just aren't true

We convince ourselves we _can't_ do something, because we are afraid of actually failing

and sometimes we need a stranger to look at us

and with fearless confidence remind us that yes

we can do it

We _are_ capable of accomplishing amazing things

And so just as that climber reminded me that day about the route I was climbing,

I am here as a stranger to remind you that yes:

you _can_ do it.

You got this.
