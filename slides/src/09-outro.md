Notes:

I'm going to close with one more story about climbing.

story

Some things we fear because we really want them. Sometimes it takes an external voice, the voice of a stranger, to say "come on". To remind us that we are capable of much more than we let ourselves be.

Just as that guy I didn't know in the bouldering cave reminded me, I am here to remind you.

You are capable of accomplishing scary things.

Come on. You got this.
