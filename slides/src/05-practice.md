# Fear-setting

Notes:

Explained by Tim Ferriss in a TED Talk

on why you should define your fears instead of your goals.

---

Trail: Practice, Fear-setting

> ...visualizing the worst-case scenarios, in detail, that you fear, preventing you from taking action, so that you can take action to overcome that paralysis.

[Tim Ferriss](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_ferriss_why_you_should_define_your_fears_instead_of_your_goals)

Notes:

He suggests...

---

Trail: Practice, Fear-setting

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/define.jpg" -->

Notes:

And he asks you to make three lists.

1. Define: define your fears.

What are you most afraid of happening that is keeping you from doing something?

---

Trail: Practice, Fear-setting

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/prevent.jpg" -->

Notes:

2. Prevent: what are some actual steps you can take

to prevent these things from happening?

---

Trail: Practice, Fear-setting

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/repair.jpg" -->

Notes:

And if it _did_ happen, how could you recover from it?

That's the 3rd list.

...

This is not all there is to fear-setting, and you can see the rest in Tim's video,

but this should get you started thinking about how you could overcome

the nightmare scenarios your fears dream up.

# Rejection Therapy

Notes:

experiment by Jia Jiang

Trail: Practice, Rejection Therapy

> My goal was to **desensitize myself** from the pain of rejection and overcome my fear

[Jia Jiang, rejectiontherapy.com](http://www.rejectiontherapy.com/)

Notes:

[jyyaaa jyahng]

he did this by forcing himself to be rejected

for 100 days straight.

from asking the cheesecake factory to sing him happy birthday when it wasn't his birthday

to trying to meet former president obama

...

There's a couple quotes from Jia that I think are really remarkable

---

Trail: Practice, Rejection Therapy

> Our imagination often takes us to the worst possible outcome, causing us to be much less likely to take that action. **We are really our own worst rejectors.**

[Jia Jiang, rejectiontherapy.com](https://www.rejectiontherapy.com/blog/2013/08/06/rejection-99-ask-strangers-to-rate-my-look/)

Notes:

...How true is that...

---

Trail: Practice, Rejection Therapy

> My rejection therapy taught me that "the worst they can say is no" is actually not true. In fact, the worst they can say is **"you didn't even ask."** It implies **I said "no" to myself** before others could reject me.

[Jia Jiang, rejectiontherapy.com](https://www.rejectiontherapy.com/blog/2013/09/04/rejection-100-why-i-want-to-meet-obama/)

Notes:

How many times have you done this?

# Rejection Ritual

Notes:

If you're going to be doing something that you know is going to involve a lot of rejection

(speaking, applying for jobs, etc)

Define a routine for yourself for every time you receive a rejection.

Trail: Practice, Rejection Ritual, Why?

## 1. Severs emotional ties

## 2. Shifts self-talk

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## 3. Habits make decisions for you

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

1. you're thinking about this fear logically instead of emotionally

slowing it down so system 2 can process it

2. to something positive, instead of dwelling on another failure,

and wondering what's wrong with you

3. When you build a habit, your response becomes automatic

You don't have to think about it - you're more likely to do the thing you want to do
