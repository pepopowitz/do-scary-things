Layout: long-quote

Trail: Practice, Fear-setting

> ...visualizing the worst-case scenarios, in detail, that you fear, preventing you from taking action, so that you can take action to overcome that paralysis.

[Tim Ferriss](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_ferriss_why_you_should_define_your_fears_instead_of_your_goals)

Notes:

He suggests...

---

Trail: Practice, Fear-setting

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/define.jpg" -->

Notes:

And he asks you to make three lists.

1. Define: define your fears.

What are you most afraid of happening that is keeping you from doing something?

---

Trail: Practice, Fear-setting

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/prevent.jpg" -->

Notes:

2. Prevent: what are some actual steps you can take

to prevent these things from happening?

---

Trail: Practice, Fear-setting

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/repair.jpg" -->

Notes:

And if it _did_ happen, how could you recover from it?

That's the 3rd list.

...

This is not all there is to fear-setting, and you can see the rest in Tim's video,

but this should get you started thinking about how you could overcome

the nightmare scenarios your fears dream up.

Layout: long-quote

Trail: Practice, Rejection Therapy

> My goal was to **desensitize myself** from the pain of rejection and overcome my fear

[Jia Jiang, rejectiontherapy.com](http://www.rejectiontherapy.com/)

Notes:

[jyyaaa jyahng]

he did this by forcing himself to be rejected

for 100 days straight.

from asking the cheesecake factory to sing him happy birthday when it wasn't his birthday

to trying to meet former president obama

...

There's a couple quotes from Jia that I think are really remarkable

Layout: long-quote

Trail: Practice, Rejection Therapy

> Our imagination often takes us to the worst possible outcome, causing us to be much less likely to take that action. **We are really our own worst rejectors.**

[Jia Jiang, rejectiontherapy.com](https://www.rejectiontherapy.com/blog/2013/08/06/rejection-99-ask-strangers-to-rate-my-look/)

Notes:

...How true is that...

Trail: Practice, Rejection Therapy

> My rejection therapy taught me that "the worst they can say is no" is actually not true. In fact, the worst they can say is **"you didn't even ask."** It implies **I said "no" to myself** before others could reject me.

Trail: Practice, Rejection Therapy

## **ha路bit路u路a路tion**

> the diminishing of a physiological or emotional response to a frequently repeated stimulus

Notes:

Rejection therapy is practice in the utmost sense

And it takes advantage of habituation

The more you experience rejection...the less uncomfortable it becomes.

# Rejection Ritual

Notes:

If you're going to be doing something that you know is going to involve a lot of rejection

(speaking, applying for jobs, etc)

Define a routine for yourself for every time you receive a rejection.

---

Layout: list

Trail: Practice, Rejection Ritual

## 1. Send a thank you

## 2. Review praise & accomplishments

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## 3. Submit two more

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

if I'm applying for jobs, I might do this every time I get rejected:

1 - for considering you

2 - that you've received elsewhere

3 -

Write this down, commit it to memory, don't forget to do it!

Trail: Practice, Rejection Ritual, Why?

## 1. Severs emotional ties

## 2. Shifts self-talk

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## 3. Habits make decisions for you

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

1 - you're thinking about this fear logically instead of emotionally

it might be that we're slowing it down so PFC can process it

2 - to something positive, instead of dwelling on another failure,

and wondering what's wrong with you

3 - When you build a habit, your response becomes automatic

You don't have to think about it - you're more likely to do the thing you want to do

When you brush your teeth in the morning, do you make a decision?

No, you just do it

...unless you're a remote worker, and then you just kind of forget for a few days

...
