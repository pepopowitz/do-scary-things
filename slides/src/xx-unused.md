Notes:

My kids when they were in kindergarten got to make a huge poster when they were the "star student"

Where they put everything you need to know about them

So I did the same

Trail: Presence

# Cartoon Voice

Notes:

maybe ditch this one

Repeat your fears in a silly cartoon voice

I'm serious

"I'm afraid of snakes because they move funny"

It sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

Helps me recognize how goofy my fears are sometimes

I thought about it long after, as more profound than it immediately seemed

We tell ourselves lies

We make ourselves believe stories about ourselves that just aren't true

We convince ourselves we _can't_ do something, because we are afraid of actually failing

and sometimes we need a stranger to look at us

and with fearless confidence remind us that yes

we can do it

We _are_ capable of accomplishing amazing things

And so just as that climber reminded me that day about the route I was climbing,

I am here as a stranger to remind you that yes:

you _can_ do it.

You got this.

Trail: Perspective

> You really are pushing yourself if you do something and it goes horrible.

Aziz Ansari

Notes:

about working on his comedy at seedy comedy clubs

"If I'm just killing all the time, I'm just worried too much about having a good time and doing a good show in that moment.

If I do a set where I just completely tank, that means I really went for something and tried something difficult.

...

let's embrace failure as a means to learn

and get better

and when you _do_ fail...

Notes:

Just like talking to the duck helps you work through coding problems

and dreams seem less scary after you talk them over with someone

Talking to your squad can help you keep your fears in perspective.

...

and that's important to help you...

Trail: Preparation, Find A Squad

## **Opportunities**

Notes:

...

4 -

There's a stigma around accepting that friends bring you opportunities

especially as humble midwesterners

But if you feel like you wouldn't pass on opportunities to them, or they wouldn't pass on opportunities to you,

do you have the right squad?

Trail: Preparation

# Identify your fear

Notes:

The first way to prepare, is to know your fear.

Sometimes this is obvious -

often it's that thing you keep talking about doing...but never start.

But sometimes it is not obvious.
