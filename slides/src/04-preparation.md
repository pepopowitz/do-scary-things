# Preparation

Notes:

Prepare to attack your fear

Trail: Preparation

# Identify your fear

Notes:

The first way to prepare, is to know your fear.

Sometimes this is obvious -

often it's that thing you keep talking about doing...but never start.

But sometimes it is not obvious.

Do some time travelling, to the future.

Write your obituary, and answer one question:

Answer it from perspective of your best friend.

if you can't figure it out....just ASK your best friend.

# Find a squad

Notes:

people you can fail in front of

or better yet, fail with

these might be people with the same goals as you

4 important things you're looking for from them:

Trail: Preparation, Find A Squad

## Psychological safety

## Accountabili-buddy

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Reassurance

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## **Opportunities**

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

1 - Feel comfortable "failing" with them

...

2 - Hold each other accountable - don't be ruinously empathic

Give difficult feedback because you **care**

...

3 - (reassurance)

that fears are not what rule you

And work through those fears and failures together.

...

4 -

There's a stigma around accepting that friends bring you opportunities

especially as humble midwesterners

But if you feel like you wouldn't pass on opportunities to them, or they wouldn't pass on opportunities to you,

do you have the right squad?

Notes:

Just like talking to the duck helps you work through coding problems

and dreams seem less scary after you talk them over with someone

Talking to your squad can help you keep your fears in perspective.

...

and that's important to help you...

# Focus on successes over failures

Notes:

We focus so much on what we don't want, rather than what we do.

This is us sabotaging ourselves.

I want to look to a couple examples outdoors to illustrate this.

Trail: Preparation, Focus On Successes

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/biking-1.jpg" -->

Notes:

This is a mountain bike trail.

When you start mountain biking, this is what the trail looks like:

---

Layout: inverse-footer

Trail: Preparation, Focus On Successes

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/biking-2.jpg" -->

Notes:

Basically, all the things that could go wrong.

But as you become a more skilled biker, the trail starts to look like this:

Trail: Preparation, Focus On Successes

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/biking-3.jpg" -->

Notes:

You see the line you want to ride, because that's the line that gets you through the fastest.

...

We see a similar example in rock climbing.

Trail: Preparation, Focus On Successes

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/route-reading.png" data-background-size="70%" -->

Notes:

When you go to a climbing gym, you'll see people doing this at the bottom of a climbing route

They're planning their route

In their heads, making sure they know what hand is going where, and when

They aren't looking at all the things they DON'T want to do - just the exact moves that they need to get up the route.

...

These are great real-life examples of focusing on successes over failures

And it'd be useful if we did the same with our careers, wouldn't it?

Notes:

One tool that can help you focus on successes instead of failures

is a wall of motivation.

# Self-handicapping

Notes:

As a word of caution...

If we spend our time focusing on failures, instead of successes,

we can end up self-handicapping.

This is when we avoid effort to keep failure from hurting us.

Example:

When you see a job posting at a company you think is out of your league

And you say "they would never hire me"

And you haven't even given them the chance to say no, or even crazier YES

This kind of behavior holds you back.
