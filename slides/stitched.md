Notes:

I'm a trail runner.

I'm a runner in general...but the trails really speak to me.

I love the sense of focus I feel on a trail -

it's my personal form of meditation,

living in the moment of every single step over every single rock.

...

I just ran a half-marathon on trails in SE wisconsin, beating my goal of 2h by 1min.

## Friday, October 25th

### Building Your First React App

### [stevenhicks.me/react-workshop/2019/10/25](https://stevenhicks.me/react-workshop/2019/10/25)

Notes:

Milwaukee at end of October: react workshop

...

3 years ago, the only one of these identities I could claim was that of an engineer.

And then I realized that I wasn't really growing

because I wasn't getting uncomfortable.

Overcoming my fears allowed me to do things I'd always wanted to do

But never actually did

...

And I'm hopeful that today I can

- help break down fear for you

- Make the things that are holding you back a little less scary

- Arm you with some strategies for overcoming fear

# Fear

Notes:

What do we fear?

...

luckily for us, someone does a survey

---

## Chapman University Survey

## of American Fears

Notes:

Chapman University in California does an annual survey of fears amongst Americans.

And there's a lot of fears in there that many of us sympathize with.

...

#1 for 2018 - any guesses?

---

Trail: Chapman University Survey of American Fears

## 74% **Corrupt government officials**

Notes:

I'm not saying which officials are corrupt...

But I think folks of all different beliefs fear this

---

### 62% **Pollution of waterways**

### 61% **Pollution of drinking water**

### 55% **Pollution of air**

Strange dogs, especially

not high on chapman's list -

**3.7%**

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/about-schmidt.jpg" -->

Notes:

I have some more long-term fears, too

like a fear of getting old

about schmidt - early 2000s

Jack Nicholson plays a retiree who finds himself **more and more alone**

as he gets older

...

When I watched this movie, my stomach hurt so bad from fear,

I wanted to curl into a ball the whole time.

And I don't think it was until I saw this movie that I realized how much I feared getting old.

---

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/steph.jpg" -->

Notes:

i fear that I'm not good enough for my wife.

She'll get sick of my **emotional immaturity**

and leave me

...

This fear is really about **relationships**

and I think I'm not alone in fearing that I'm going to mess up a relationship.

...

some people fear

- being in them
- not being in them
- messing them up
- raising kids poorly

---

Notes:

and work. Who has fears about work?

Who _doesn't_ have fears about work?

- I get incredible anxiety over sending a calendar invite to more than 2 people.
- taking a job you'll regret
- asking for a raise - uncomfortable conversations
- telling my boss how I really feel - afraid I'll get fired
- take ownership of a feature/project/system - afraid of the commitment

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/friends.jpg" -->

Notes:

then there's another subclass of fears

that deal with **acceptance from our peers**

---

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/peacock.jpg" -->

Notes:

i fear self-promotion

i fear being rejected as being **too braggy**

or being found out that I'm **not worth self-promoting**

I went back and forth on pulling those slides out 25 times.

Notes:

many fear public speaking

you might have heard that people fear it more than death

According to the Chapman research, **not true**.

27.9% for death, 26% for public speaking

...

and these fears, and many like them, are all kind of the **same basic fear**

---

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/alone.jpg" -->

Notes:

the fear of rejection

these fears of rejection are what i'm really interested in today

because these are the fears that prevent us from doing great things with our career

from deciding to **publish a blog**

or a **book**

or **start speaking**

or take on a **new role or responsibilities** that we think are really neat

but are too scared of

or **quitting our job and going freelance**

---

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/me-teaching.jpg" -->

Notes:

On a personal level, overcoming these kinds of fears are the best move I've made in my career

It got me speaking across the Midwest, into Canada, and here today in front of you as a keynote speaker

And that got me my current job - my friend Jon from Artsy came to one of my talks

I'm hopeful that helping you overcome your fears can change your life like it's changed mine.

---

# \* **I am not a doctor.**

Notes:

A really quick disclaimer:

I am not a professional psychologist, and I am making shit up.

The "fear" I'm talking about today is not the kind of fear based on terrifying life events,

that leaves you curled up in a ball in a corner or unable to function.

I don't have any ability to discuss, diagnose, or treat that level of fear.

I _do_ have the ability to support you and assist you in finding help - so if that describes you, and you _want_ help, I'll help you get in contact with someone. See me later.

For this talk, I'm speaking about the kinds of fears that hinder you from being the best version of you.

# Why Do We Fear?

Notes:

Over-simplified, the popular science looks like this:
---

Trail: Why Do We Fear?

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/brain-fear-1.jpg" -->

TODO: image of brain with limbic system

Notes:

There is a group of structures in our brain

that form the "limbic system".

this system is involved in many of our **emotions and motivations**

especially those **related to survival.**

Like **fear, anger, memory,** and emotions related to **reproduction.**

---

Trail: Why Do We Fear?

TODO: image of brain with limbic system + sensory inputs

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/brain-fear-2.jpg" -->

Notes:

And the limbic system has many functions, but one of its main functions,

is to **take sensory inputs**...

---

Trail: Why Do We Fear?

TODO: image of brain with limbic system + inputs + sending to PFC

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/brain-fear-3.jpg" -->

Notes:

and send them to be **triaged** in the prefrontal cortex.

The prefrontal cortex is a newer part of the brain - **more evolved**.

It does a pretty solid job of **identifying threats (or non-threats)**

---

Trail: Why Do We Fear?

TODO: image of brain with limbic system + inputs + PFC + response

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/brain-fear-4.jpg" -->

Notes:

and then it can **trigger** an appropriate physical **response.**

...

BUT...

The PFC is SLOW.

---

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/tiger.jpg" -->

Notes:

And sometimes we don't have a lot of time to process threats

So, the limbic system...

---

Trail: Why Do We Fear?

TODO: image of brain with limbic system + inputs + !!! response !!!

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/brain-fear-5.jpg" -->

Notes:

Has the security clearance to make snap judgments

And provoke the body into a response

without involving the smarter, slower, PFC

This is often where you feel fight or flight

---

Trail: Why Do We Fear?

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/pizza.jpg" -->

Notes:

It's sort of like how every time I put a pizza in the oven, the smoke alarm in my hallway goes off.

I know it's not a fire. But the smoke alarm, my limbic system, responds quicker than I (or my PFC) can.

---

Trail: Why Do We Fear?

TODO: image of brain with limbic system + inputs + !!! response !!!

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/brain-fear-5.jpg" -->

Notes:

This system is great!

It's like legacy code -

it has helped our species survive, and it works, so just nobody touch it.

...

We are **born with** this system

and the **ability to fear things**

But current studies seem to indicate...

---

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/no-fear.jpg" -->

Notes:

we aren't actually born with any fears

we MIGHT be born with the fear of **loud sounds**

but even that is **up for debate**

we also develop a fear of **falling** pretty early, but that doesn't appear to be at birth

the majority, if not all, of our **fears are learned**.

---

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/spider.jpg" -->

Notes:

we seem to be **predisposed** to learn some fears

the **primal ones**

snakes & spiders, especially.

...

But most of our fears we learn by association

---

Trail: Why Do We Fear?

TODO: image of brain with limbic system + inputs + !!! response !!!

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/brain-fear-5.jpg" -->

Notes:

The limbic system that gets to make snap judgments on inputs -

It does so with simple pattern matching.

If it looks like something we associate with a threat,

It gets categorized as something worth fearing.

---

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/dog.jpg" -->

Notes:

It might be that **we have an experience**, and associate sharp teeth with something we should fear

Or it might be **our parents act fearful** around sharp pointy dog teeth, because they've been bitten, and we associate sharp pointy dog teeth with our parents fear

---

TODO: image of Lila

Notes:

This explains why my oldest daughter,

who has never had a bad experience with a dog,

**climbed me like a tree** a couple years ago, shrieking, when a dog came running up to her.

[Explain why].

---

TODO: image of snowball

Notes:

This pattern matching is also why once you develop a fear of something,

It grows worse over time

The pattern matching continues to associate this thing with a threat

Even if it never really was one.

---

TODO: image of Olivia with snakes

Notes:

There's no guarantee you'll learn a fear by association

For example, I mentioned that I am terrified of snakes....

my youngest daughter, Olivia, is absolutely _not_ afraid of snakes.

---

TODO: zoom of Olivia with snakes

Notes:

...as you can see if we zoom and enhance this photo

[explain situation]

---

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/alone.jpg" -->

Notes:

That's some science behind fear.

Let's explore what we _feel_ when we fear something.

These fears that I'm interested in - of **rejection**

They come from a few emotional places.

---

# We are concerned how **others perceive us**

Notes:

We don't want them to see us as unlike them

</div>
[waitbutwhy.com](waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html)

Notes:

Tim Urban, of the website waitbutwhy.com:

Has an amazing article about what he calls "the Social Survival Mammoth"

that **bullies us into fearing even an ounce of rejection**.

The science behind the mammoth, Tim argues, is that thousands of years ago, when we lived in caves, being rejected meant **being pushed out of the cave** and sleeping with the saber toothed tigers.

Our **biology hasn't evolved** as quickly as our **civilizations have**...and so we're stuck with this fear, this mammoth that's been hanging around for far too long, and doesn't make much sense anymore.

...

From my research I **don't think this is a fear we are born with**...but I think it is probably one that we are extremely **susceptible to**, and it doesn't take much for us to learn it.

...

In the end, Tim's post aims to **help us realize one really important thing**:

---

> Almost nothing you’re socially scared of is actually scary.

[Tim Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com)

Notes:

...

another thing that happens with fear:

---

# We see others succeed

## **and compare ourselves to them**

Notes:

This isn't helpful,

and in fact it's a major cause of **Imposter Syndrome**

And really, **it's untrue**,

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/success-1.jpg" -->

Notes:

because **we see their path** to success looking like this

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/success-2.jpg" -->

Notes:

when **in reality it looks just like ours** - like this.

...

and all those twists and turns

---

# We see ourselves **failing**

Notes:

are where we see ourselves failing.

This effect is magnified in the social media era

Facebook, Twitter, etc

are causing **damaging psychological effects**

because of this nature to compare ourselves

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/outcomes-1.jpg" data-background-size="80%"  -->

Notes:

Humans are really good at **seeing the negative possibilities.**

(In the **tech industry**, we are **extremely good**.)

If we look at the possible **range of outcomes** in a situation, there's a whole bunch of good ones, and a whole bunch of bad ones

...

we'll focus on the worst ones.

we might look at **one or two of the good ones**, but mostly we focus on the really awful ones.

---

Footer: false

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/outcomes-2.jpg" data-background-size="80%" -->

Notes:

so if we are offered a choice between two options -

one in which the range of outcomes look like this,

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/outcomes-3.jpg" data-background-size="80%" -->

Notes:

and one in which the range of outcomes look like this,

which one do you think we take?

We take the one with the **high floor but low ceiling**

because it has the **least scary negative** outcomes.

Even though this other option clearly has the most amazing outcomes for us.

...

This risk avoidance works great when the risks are realistic

But our brain tells us stories, and very often those stories are unfounded lies.

# Strategies for

# **Overcoming Fear**

Notes:

And so...with some better understanding of the nature of fear,

I'd like to offer you some strategies for overcoming the fears that are holding you back.

---

Layout: module

# Preparation

Notes:

Prepare to attack your fear

---

Trail: Preparation

# Identify your fear

Notes:

The first way to prepare, is to know your fear.

Sometimes this is obvious -

often it's that thing you keep talking about doing...but never start.

But sometimes it is not obvious.

---

Trail: Preparation, Identify Your Fear

# Write your obituary

## **What held you back in life?**

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

Do some time travelling, to the future.

Write your obituary, and answer one question:

(click)

Answer it from perspective of your best friend.

if you can't figure it out....just ASK your best friend.

---

Trail: Preparation

# Find a squad

Notes:

people you can fail in front of

or better yet, fail with

these might be people with the same goals as you

4 important things you're looking for from them:

---

Trail: Preparation, Find A Squad

## Psychological safety

## Accountabili-buddy

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Reassurance

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## **Opportunities**

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

1 - Feel comfortable "failing" with them

...

2 - Hold each other accountable - don't be ruinously empathic

Give difficult feedback because you **care**

...

3 - (reassurance)

that fears are not what rule you

And work through those fears and failures together.

...

4 -

There's a stigma around accepting that friends bring you opportunities

especially as humble midwesterners

But if you feel like you wouldn't pass on opportunities to them, or they wouldn't pass on opportunities to you,

do you have the right squad?

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/duck.jpg" -->

Notes:

Just like talking to the duck helps you work through coding problems

and dreams seem less scary after you talk them over with someone

Talking to your squad can help you keep your fears in perspective.

...

and that's important to help you...

# Focus on successes over failures

Notes:

We focus so much on what we don't want, rather than what we do.

This is us sabotaging ourselves.

I want to look to a couple examples outdoors to illustrate this.

Trail: Preparation, Focus On Successes

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/route-reading.jpg" data-background-size="70%" -->

Notes:

When you go to a climbing gym, you'll see people doing this at the bottom of a climbing route

They're planning their route

In their heads, making sure they know what hand is going where, and when

They aren't looking at all the things they DON'T want to do - just the exact moves that they need to get up the route.

...

These are great real-life examples of focusing on successes over failures

And it'd be useful if we did the same with our careers, wouldn't it?

# Self-handicapping

Notes:

As a word of caution...

If we spend our time focusing on failures, instead of successes,

we can end up self-handicapping.

This is when we avoid effort to keep failure from hurting us.

# Fear-setting

Notes:

Explained by Tim Ferriss in a TED Talk

on why you should define your fears instead of your goals.

---

Layout: long-quote

Trail: Practice, Fear-setting

> ...visualizing the worst-case scenarios, in detail, that you fear, preventing you from taking action, so that you can take action to overcome that paralysis.

[Tim Ferriss](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_ferriss_why_you_should_define_your_fears_instead_of_your_goals)

Notes:

He suggests...

---

Trail: Practice, Fear-setting

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/define.jpg" -->

And he asks you to make three lists.

1. Define: define your fears.

What are you most afraid of happening that is keeping you from doing something?

2. Prevent: what are some actual steps you can take

to prevent these things from happening?

---

Trail: Practice, Fear-setting

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/repair.jpg" -->

Notes:

And if it _did_ happen, how could you recover from it?

That's the 3rd list.

This is not all there is to fear-setting, and you can see the rest in Tim's video,

but this should get you started thinking about how you could overcome

the nightmare scenarios your fears dream up.

# Rejection Therapy

Trail: Practice, Rejection Therapy

> My goal was to **desensitize myself** from the pain of rejection and overcome my fear

[Jia Jiang, rejectiontherapy.com](http://www.rejectiontherapy.com/)

Notes:

[jyyaaa jyahng]

he did this by forcing himself to be rejected

for 100 days straight.

from asking the cheesecake factory to sing him happy birthday when it wasn't his birthday

to trying to meet former president obama

...

There's a couple quotes from Jia that I think are really remarkable

---

Layout: long-quote

Trail: Practice, Rejection Therapy

> Our imagination often takes us to the worst possible outcome, causing us to be much less likely to take that action. **We are really our own worst rejectors.**

[Jia Jiang, rejectiontherapy.com](https://www.rejectiontherapy.com/blog/2013/08/06/rejection-99-ask-strangers-to-rate-my-look/)

Notes:

...How true is that...

---

Layout: long-quote

Trail: Practice, Rejection Therapy

> My rejection therapy taught me that "the worst they can say is no" is actually not true. In fact, the worst they can say is **"you didn't even ask."** It implies **I said "no" to myself** before others could reject me.

Rejection therapy is practice in the utmost sense

And it takes advantage of habituation

# Rejection Ritual

Notes:

If you're going to be doing something that you know is going to involve a lot of rejection

(speaking, applying for jobs, etc)

Define a routine for yourself for every time you receive a rejection.

---

Layout: list

Trail: Practice, Rejection Ritual

## 1. Send a thank you

## 2. Review praise & accomplishments

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## 3. Submit two more

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

if I'm applying for jobs, I might do this every time I get rejected:

1 - for considering you

2 - that you've received elsewhere

3 -

Write this down, commit it to memory, don't forget to do it!

---

Layout: list
Trail: Practice, Rejection Ritual, Why?

## 1. Severs emotional ties

## 2. Shifts self-talk

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## 3. Habits make decisions for you

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

1 - you're thinking about this fear logically instead of emotionally

it might be that we're slowing it down so PFC can process it

2 - to something positive, instead of dwelling on another failure,

and wondering what's wrong with you

3 - When you build a habit, your response becomes automatic

You don't have to think about it - you're more likely to do the thing you want to do

When you brush your teeth in the morning, do you make a decision?

No, you just do it

...unless you're a remote worker, and then you just kind of forget for a few days

# Recognize And Name The Emotion

Notes:

Fear is a pretty general emotion, and it can be helpful for you to be more specific about what's going on

---

<div class="double-wide">
  <h3>insecure</h3>
  <h3><strong>inadequate</strong></h3>
  <h3><strong>anxious</strong></h3>
  <h3>threatened</h3>
  <h3>trapped</h3>
  <h3><strong>lonely</strong></h3>
</div>

Notes:

Here are some more specific fearful emotions you might feel:

...

The act of trying to name your emotion

Might activate the PFC

Gives it some time to catch up.

It definitely gives your body the sense that things are slowing down so you can process them properly

---

# Meditation

Notes:

Possible Benefits -

1 - Levels emotional responses, you become better at treating emotions as facts, not inescapable feelings

2 - Increases your persistence

...

For years I've been trying to start a meditation habit

This year, I'm finally making real progress

I started tracking my daily mood, and I noticed my best days

were the days I got a morning workout & I meditated.

Now I do it regularly, setting myself up for success every day.

# Problem Solving

Notes:

The next group is Problem Solving.

Which, as developers, we are really good at.

And I recommend a simple approach to solving big, scary problems:

---

Layout: list

Trail: Problem Solving

## **1. Identify The Crux**

Notes:

In climbing, there is the notion of "the crux" on every route.

It is the single hardest move on the route

Routes in climbing have ratings,

and those ratings are generally based on the crux.

...

The key, with the crux, is get yourself into the right position that you can make that one move.

And then plan your route backwards from there.

...

In the context of doing something scary, I'd consider the crux

the absolute scariest part. The thing you are most terrified of.

Get as specific as you can, because step 2....

Layout: list

Trail: Problem Solving

## 1. Identify The Crux

## **2. Eat The Frog**

Layout: list

Trail: Problem Solving

## 1. Identify The Crux

## 2. Eat The Frog

## **3. Repeat**

Notes:

Find the _next_ scariest part, and figure out a way to address it.

...

And that's a pretty good way to handle any real-life problem.

Especially a big scary one.

Iterate over the scariest parts.

...

And this is pretty similar to the approach DDEisenhower used to manage his time.

# Embrace Failure

Notes:

We live in an amazing time.

Thanks to tech startups, failure is fully embraced right now.

That was definitely not the case when we were kids.

This is great!

Aziz Ansari

Notes:

about working on his comedy at seedy comedy clubs

"If I'm just killing all the time, I'm just worried too much about having a good time and doing a good show in that moment.

If I do a set where I just completely tank, that means I really went for something and tried something difficult.

...

let's embrace failure as a means to learn

and get better

and when you _do_ fail...

# Forgive Yourself

Notes:

Treat yourself as you would treat a friend

If your best friend tries something amazing

and doesn't get the outcome they wanted

Do you beat them up for failing?

You don't. And you shouldn't do it to yourself, either.

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/bouldering.jpg" -->

Notes:

I'm going to close with one more story about climbing.

story

I thought about it long after, as more profound than it immediately seemed

We tell ourselves lies

We make ourselves believe stories about ourselves that just aren't true

We convince ourselves we _can't_ do something, because we are afraid of actually failing

and sometimes we need a stranger to look at us

and with fearless confidence remind us that yes

we can do it

We _are_ capable of accomplishing amazing things

And so just as that climber reminded me that day about the route I was climbing,

I am here as a stranger to remind you that yes:

you _can_ do it.

You got this.
