Notes:

Engineer at Artsy

NYC, MKE

our mission is to expand the art market,

and we're doing that with a platform for collecting and discovering art.

---

TODO: image of JS

Notes:

I love JavaScript

I have for years. I started working with it at the beginning of my career, in 1999.

JS in 1999 - _that's_ a scary thing.

---

TODO: image of trail running

Notes:

I'm a trail runner.

I'm a runner in general...but the trails really speak to me.

I love the sense of focus I feel on a trail -

it's my personal form of meditation,

living in the moment of every single step over every single rock.

...

I just ran a half-marathon on trails in SE wisconsin, beating my goal of 2h by 1min.

TODO: image of CCC

[creamcitycode.com](creamcitycode.com)

Notes:

I'm an organizer of the Cream City Code conference, in Milwaukee.

It was last weekend, did anyone go?

[stevenhicks.me/articles](stevenhicks.me/articles)

[artsy.github.io](artsy.github.io)

Notes:

I'm a writer, at these URLs

---

TODO: image of speaking

Notes:

I'm a speaker

I've spoken at conferences throughout the Midwest, giving over 40 talks.

---

TODO: image of workshop

Notes:

I'm a teacher

I currently teach workshops on React and TDD

Plug upcoming event in October

...

Three years ago, the only one of these identities I could claim was that of a developer.

Something something overcome fear for incredible growth.

TODO: image of fear

# Fear

Notes:

What do we fear?

...

luckily for us, someone does a survey

---

TODO: chapman university survey info

Notes:

Chapman University in ??? does an annual survey of fears amongst Americans.

And there's a lot of fears in there that many of us sympathize with.

...

#1 for 2018 - any guesses?

---

TODO: image of 1. Corruption of government officials

Notes:

I'm not saying which officials are corrupt...

But I think folks of all different beliefs fear this

---

TODO: image of Environmental:

- 2. Pollution of waterways (62%)
- 3. Pollution of drinking water (61%)
- 7. Pollution of air (55%)
- 8. Extinction of plant and animal species (54%)
- 9. Global warming/climate change (53%)

Notes:

Many of the top-rated fears were related to the environment

---

TODO: image of Financial:

- 4. Not having enough \$\$ for future (57%)
- 10. High medical bills (53%)

Notes:

Financial/economic

---

TODO: image Health:

- 5. People I love becoming seriously ill (57%)
- 6. People I love dying (56%)

Notes:

...

and that's great and fun, and we could look at this list all day,

but it's impersonal.

I want to get more personal.

starting with some PRIMAL fears

---

TODO: image of dog

Notes:

I fear dogs

Strange dogs, mostly

not high on chapman's list - 94th, 3.7%

(story of being bit)

fears can be passed on to our children: story of Lila

---

TODO: image of snake

Notes:

Significantly more common - 62nd/24%

I am creeped out by how they move

...

not ALL fears are passed on to our children

---

TODO: image of Olivia with snakes

Notes:

story of Olivia

---

TODO: zoom of Olivia with snakes

---

TODO: image of mashed potatoes

Notes:

I found out my dad is afraid of not being understood

(story of mashed potatoes in kfc in costa rica)

---

TODO: image of getting old

Notes:

I have some more long-term fears, too

like a fear of getting old

about schmidt?

Jack Nicholson plays a retiree who finds himself **more and more alone**

as he gets older

...

When I watched this movie, my stomach hurt so bad from fear,

I wanted to curl into a ball the whole time.

And I don't think it was until I saw this movie that I realized how much I feared getting old.

---

TODO: image of Steph

Notes:

i fear that I'm not good enough for my wife.

She'll get sick of my **emotional immaturity**

and leave me

...

This fear is really about **relationships**

and I think I'm not alone in fearing that I'm going to mess up a relationship.

...

some people fear

- being in them
- not being in them
- messing them up
- raising kids poorly

---

TODO: image of work

Notes:

and work. Who has fears about work?

Who _doesn't_ have fears about work?

- I get incredible anxiety over sending a calendar invite to more than 2 people.
- taking a job you'll regret
- asking for a raise - uncomfortable conversations
- telling my boss how I really feel - afraid I'll get fired
- take ownership of a feature/project/system - afraid of the commitment

---

TODO: image of acceptance

Notes:

then there's another subclass of fears

that deal with **acceptance from our peers**

---

TODO: image of self-promotion

Notes:

i fear self-promotion

i fear being rejected as being **too braggy**

or being found out that I'm **not worth self-promoting**

I did a whole lot of it at the beginning of this talk, and _it was excruciating_.

I went back and forth on pulling those slides out 25 times.

---

TODO: image of looking dumb

Notes:

lack of knowledge

i'm going to look dumb

i.e. imposter syndrome

---

TODO: image of public speaking

Notes:

many fear public speaking

you might have heard that people fear it more than death

According to the Chapman research, **not true**.

27.9% for death, 26% for public speaking

...

and these fears, and many like them, are all kind of the **same basic fear**

---

TODO: image of rejection

Notes:

the fear of rejection

these fears of rejection are what i'm really interested in today

because these are the fears that prevent us from doing great things with our career

from deciding to **publish a blog**

or a **book**

or **start speaking**

or take on a **new role or responsibilities** that we think are really neat

but are too scared of

or **quitting our job and going freelance**

---

TODO: image of speaking again?

Notes:

On a personal level, overcoming these kinds of fears are the best move I've made in my career

It got me speaking across the Midwest, into Canada, and here today in front of you as a keynote speaker

And that got me my current job - my friend Jon from Artsy came to one of my talks

I'm hopeful that helping you overcome your fears can change your life like it's changed mine.

---

TODO: legit help info

Notes:

A really quick disclaimer:

I am not a professional psychologist, and I am making shit up.

The "fear" I'm talking about today is not the kind of fear based on terrifying life events,

that leaves you curled up in a ball in a corner or unable to function.

I don't have any ability to discuss, diagnose, or treat that level of fear.

I _do_ have the ability to support you and assist you in finding help - so if that describes you, and you _want_ help, I'll help you get in contact with someone. See me later.

For this talk, I'm speaking about the kinds of fears that hinder you from being the best version of you.
