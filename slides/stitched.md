TODO: image of JS

Notes:

I love JavaScript

I have for years. I started working with it at the beginning of my career, in 1999.

JS in 1999 - _that's_ a scary thing.

---

TODO: image of trail running

Notes:

I'm a trail runner.

I'm a runner in general...but the trails really speak to me.

I love the sense of focus I feel on a trail -

it's my personal form of meditation,

living in the moment of every single step over every single rock.

...

I just ran a half-marathon on trails in SE wisconsin, beating my goal of 2h by 1min.

Notes:

I'm a teacher

I currently teach workshops on React and TDD

Plug upcoming event in October

...

Three years ago, the only one of these identities I could claim was that of a developer.

Something something overcome fear for incredible growth.

# Fear

Notes:

What do we fear?

...

luckily for us, someone does a survey

---

TODO: chapman university survey info

Notes:

Chapman University in ??? does an annual survey of fears amongst Americans.

And there's a lot of fears in there that many of us sympathize with.

...

#1 for 2018 - any guesses?

---

TODO: image of 1. Corruption of government officials

Notes:

I'm not saying which officials are corrupt...

But I think folks of all different beliefs fear this

---

TODO: image of Environmental:

- 2. Pollution of waterways (62%)
- 3. Pollution of drinking water (61%)
- 7. Pollution of air (55%)
- 8. Extinction of plant and animal species (54%)
- 9. Global warming/climate change (53%)

Notes:

Many of the top-rated fears were related to the environment

- 10. High medical bills (53%)

Notes:

Financial/economic

- 5. People I love becoming seriously ill (57%)
- 6. People I love dying (56%)

Notes:

...

and that's great and fun, and we could look at this list all day,

but it's impersonal.

I want to get more personal.

starting with some PRIMAL fears

---

TODO: image of dog

Notes:

I fear dogs

Strange dogs, mostly

not high on chapman's list - 94th, 3.7%

(story of being bit)

---

TODO: image of snake

Notes:

Significantly more common - 62nd/24%

I am creeped out by how they move

---

TODO: image of mashed potatoes

Notes:

I found out my dad is afraid of not being understood

(story of mashed potatoes in kfc in costa rica)

---

TODO: image of getting old

Notes:

I have some more long-term fears, too

like a fear of getting old

about schmidt?

Jack Nicholson plays a retiree who finds himself **more and more alone**

as he gets older

...

When I watched this movie, my stomach hurt so bad from fear,

I wanted to curl into a ball the whole time.

And I don't think it was until I saw this movie that I realized how much I feared getting old.

---

TODO: image of Steph

Notes:

i fear that I'm not good enough for my wife.

She'll get sick of my **emotional immaturity**

and leave me

...

This fear is really about **relationships**

and I think I'm not alone in fearing that I'm going to mess up a relationship.

...

some people fear

- being in them
- not being in them
- messing them up
- raising kids poorly

---

TODO: image of work

Notes:

and work. Who has fears about work?

Who _doesn't_ have fears about work?

- I get incredible anxiety over sending a calendar invite to more than 2 people.
- taking a job you'll regret
- asking for a raise - uncomfortable conversations
- telling my boss how I really feel - afraid I'll get fired
- take ownership of a feature/project/system - afraid of the commitment

---

TODO: image of acceptance

Notes:

then there's another subclass of fears

that deal with **acceptance from our peers**

---

TODO: image of self-promotion

Notes:

i fear self-promotion

i fear being rejected as being **too braggy**

or being found out that I'm **not worth self-promoting**

I did a whole lot of it at the beginning of this talk, and _it was excruciating_.

I went back and forth on pulling those slides out 25 times.

---

TODO: image of looking dumb

Notes:

lack of knowledge

i'm going to look dumb

i.e. imposter syndrome

---

TODO: image of public speaking

Notes:

many fear public speaking

you might have heard that people fear it more than death

According to the Chapman research, **not true**.

27.9% for death, 26% for public speaking

...

and these fears, and many like them, are all kind of the **same basic fear**

---

TODO: image of rejection

Notes:

the fear of rejection

these fears of rejection are what i'm really interested in today

because these are the fears that prevent us from doing great things with our career

from deciding to **publish a blog**

or a **book**

or **start speaking**

or take on a **new role or responsibilities** that we think are really neat

but are too scared of

or **quitting our job and going freelance**

---

TODO: image of speaking again?

Notes:

On a personal level, overcoming these kinds of fears are the best move I've made in my career

It got me speaking across the Midwest, into Canada, and here today in front of you as a keynote speaker

And that got me my current job - my friend Jon from Artsy came to one of my talks

I'm hopeful that helping you overcome your fears can change your life like it's changed mine.

---

TODO: legit help info

Notes:

A really quick disclaimer:

I am not a professional psychologist, and I am making shit up.

The "fear" I'm talking about today is not the kind of fear based on terrifying life events,

that leaves you curled up in a ball in a corner or unable to function.

I don't have any ability to discuss, diagnose, or treat that level of fear.

I _do_ have the ability to support you and assist you in finding help - so if that describes you, and you _want_ help, I'll help you get in contact with someone. See me later.

For this talk, I'm speaking about the kinds of fears that hinder you from being the best version of you.

# Why Do We Fear?

Notes:

Over-simplified, the popular science looks like this:
---

# Limbic system

TODO: image of limbic system

Notes:

looks like this.

There is a group of structures in our brain

that form the "limbic system".

this system is involved in many of our **emotions and motivations**

especially those **related to survival.**

Like **fear, anger,** and emotions related to **reproduction.**

---

# Limbic system

TODO: image of limbic system processing

Notes:

And the limbic system has many functions, but one of its main functions,

is to **take sensory inputs**

and send them to be **triaged**

so that **threats can be identified**

and then **trigger** an appropriate physical **response.**

---

TODO: image of danger

Notes:

if we see something dangerous,

our limbic system does some pattern matching,

says "bweep bweep bweep"

and we run, before we even realize what's happening.

...

So there's **great value** in the limbic system

and in our fears

---

TODO: image of cookies

Notes:

There's other values to fear, too

like what I like to call the **salty/sweet principle**

have you ever forgotten to add salt to chocolate chip cookies?

it doesn't taste right.

but you add a little bit of salt - not much

and your cookies actually taste sweeter, not saltier.

...

similarly, **if we didn't have fear**...

we wouldn't have those **contrasting feelings of overcoming** fear

which feel really amazing.

---

# Limbic System

TODO: image of limbic system

Notes:

So we are **born with** this limbic system

and the **ability to fear things**

But current studies seem to indicate...

---

TODO: image of lack of fear

Notes:

we aren't actually born with any fears

we MIGHT be born with the fear of **loud sounds**

but even that is **up for debate**

we also develop a fear of **falling** pretty early, but that doesn't appear to be at birth

the majority, if not all, of our **fears are learned**.

---

TODO: image of spider

Notes:

we seem to be **predisposed** to learn some fears

the **primal ones**

snakes & spiders, especially

the rest....

---

TODO: image of dog

Notes:

we learn by association.

It might be that **we have an experience**, and associate sharp teeth with something we should fear

Or it might be **our parents act fearful** around sharp pointy dog teeth, because they've been bitten, and we associate sharp pointy dog teeth with our parents fear

---

TODO: image of Lila

Notes:

This explains why my oldest daughter,

who has never had a bad experience with a dog,

**climbed me like a tree** a couple years ago, shrieking, when a dog came running up to her.

[Explain why].

---

TODO: image of Olivia with snakes

Notes:

There's no guarantee you'll learn a fear by association

For example, I mentioned that I am terrified of snakes....

my youngest daughter, Olivia, is absolutely _not_ afraid of snakes.

---

TODO: zoom of Olivia with snakes

Notes:

...as you can see if we zoom and enhance this photo

[explain situation]

---

TODO: image of system failing

Notes:

so as you can see, sometimes the **system fails.**

we can **impart fears** on our children unintentionally.

...

there's also something called...

---

# Amygdala Hijack

Notes:

---

TODO: image of emotional intelligence book

Notes:

this term comes from the book Emotional Intelligence

by Daniel Goleman

---

# Amygdala

TODO: image of amygdala

Notes:

The structure at the center of your fight or flight reactions

is called the amygdala

(Note: you might have heard it's responsible for fear, but it's only part of a system.)

It is basically like the **smoke alarm** in our brain.

It's one of the **first things to be notified** by our senses when we perceive external stimuli

This is basically what has **allowed us to survive** as a species.

---

Trail: Amygdala

# The Happy Path

TODO: image of happy path (including added sequence numbers)

Notes:

when everything is working correctly,

the amygdala can get the inputs and send them to the smarter parts of your brain

to figure out if they are a threat or not.

---

Trail: Amygdala

# The Hijack

TODO: image of hijack

Notes:

but sometimes there isn't enough time to wait for an official assessment.

and so the amygdala sends out a **panic alarm**

before your prefontal cortex can evaluate the threat and say "whoa - not a big deal."

---

TODO: image of pizza burning

Notes:

It's sort of like how every time I put a pizza in the oven, the smoke alarm in my hallway goes off.

I know it's not a fire. But the smoke alarm, aka amygdala, responds quicker than I (or my prefontal cortex) can.

---

TODO: image of lizard

Notes:

And in fact, the amygdala is so simplistic, that it's often referred to as **the lizard brain**

It's a part of our brain that evolved a long time ago, when we were lizards,

and our only primal concerns were **surviving, reproducing, and not much else.**

Author **Seth Godin** has a video where he talks about quieting your lizard brain.

---

TODO: image of fear as an emotion

Notes:

That's the science behind fear.

Let's look more from the emotional side.

These fears that I'm interested in - of **rejection**

They come from a few emotional places.

---

# We are concerned how **others perceive us**

Notes:

We don't them to see us as unlike them

---

TODO: image of waitbutwhy.com
[waitbutwhy.com/???](waitbutwhy.com/???)

Notes:

Tim Urban, of the website waitbutwhy.com:

Has an amazing article about what he calls "the Social Survival Mammoth"

that **bullies us into fearing even an ounce of rejection**.

The science behind the mammoth, Tim argues, is that thousands of years ago, when we lived in caves, being rejected meant **being pushed out of the cave** and sleeping with the saber toothed tigers.

Our **biology hasn't evolved** as quickly as our **civilizations have**...and so we're stuck with this fear, which doesn't make much sense anymore.

...

From my research I **don't think this is a fear we are born with**...but I think it is probably one that we are extremely **susceptible to**, and it doesn't take much for us to learn it.

...

In the end, Tim's post aims to **help us realize one really important thing**:

---

> Almost nothing you’re socially scared of is actually scary.

[Tim Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com)

Notes:

...

another thing that happens with fear:

---

# We see others succeed

## **and compare ourselves to them**

Notes:

This isn't helpful,

and in fact it's a major cause of **Imposter Syndrome**

And really, **it's untrue**,

---

TODO: image of their easy path

Notes:

because **we see their path** to success looking like this

---

TODO: image of our hard path

Notes:

when **in reality it looks just like ours** - like this.

...

and all those twists and turns

---

# We see ourselves **failing**

Notes:

are where we see ourselves failing.

This effect is magnified in the social media era

Facebook, Twitter, etc

are causing **damaging psychological effects**

because of this nature to compare ourselves

---

TODO: image of possible outcomes

Notes:

Humans are really good at **seeing the negative possibilities.**

(In the **tech industry**, we are **extremely good**.)

If we look at the possible **range of outcomes** in a situation, there's a whole bunch of good ones, and a whole bunch of bad ones

...

we'll focus on the worst ones.

we might look at **one or two of the good ones**, but mostly we focus on the really awful ones.

---

TODO: image of low ceiling, high floor

Notes:

so if we are offered a choice between two options -

one in which the range of outcomes look like this,

---

TODO: image of high ceiling, low floor

Notes:

and one in which the range of outcomes look like this,

which one do you think we take?

We take the one with the **high floor but low ceiling**

because it has the **least scary negative** outcomes.

Even though this other option clearly has the most amazing outcomes for us.

...

Our brain tells us stories, and very often those stories are unfounded lies.

# Strategies for

# **Overcoming Fear**

Notes:

And so...with some better understanding of the nature of fear,

I'd like to offer you some strategies for overcoming the fears that are holding you back.

---

# Preparation

Notes:

Prepare to attack your fear

---

Trail: Preparation

# Identify your fear

Notes:

The first way to prepare, is to know your fear.

Sometimes this is obvious -

often it's that thing you keep talking about doing...but never start.

But sometimes it is not obvious.

---

Trail: Preparation, Identify Your Fear

# Write your obituary

## **What held you back in life?**

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

Do some time travelling.

Write it from perspective of your best friend.

if you can't figure it out....just ASK your best friend.

---

Trail: Preparation

# Find a squad

Notes:

people you can fail in front of

or better yet, fail with

these might be people with the same goals as you

4 important things you're looking for from them:

---

Trail: Preparation, Find A Squad

## Psychological safety

## Accountabili-buddy

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Reassurance

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## **Opportunities**

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

- Feel comfortable "failing" with them

...

- Hold each other accountable - don't be ruinously empathic

Give difficult feedback because you **care**

...

that fears are not what rule you

And work through those fears and failures together.

---

TODO: image of duck

Notes:

Just like talking to the duck helps you work through coding problems

and dreams seem less scary after you talk them over with someone

Talking to your squad can help you keep your fears in perspective.

---

Trail: Preparation

# Focus on successes over failures

Notes:

We focus so much on what we don't want, rather than what we do.

This is us sabotaging ourselves.

I want to look to a couple examples outdoors to illustrate this.

---

Trail: Preparation, Focus On Successes

TODO: image of MTB trail

Notes:

This is a mountain bike trail.

When you start mountain biking, this is what the trail looks like:

---

Trail: Preparation, Focus On Successes

TODO: image of obstacles

Notes:

Basically, all the things that could go wrong.

But as you become a more skilled biker, the trail starts to look like this:

---

Trail: Preparation, Focus On Successes

TODO: image of ideal line

Notes:

You see the line you want to ride, because that's the line that gets you through the fastest.

...

We see a similar example in rock climbing.

---

Trail: Preparation, Focus On Successes

TODO: image of climbing/route reading

Notes:

When you go to a climbing gym, you'll see people doing this at the bottom of a climbing route

They're planning their route

In their heads, making sure they know what hand is going where, and when

They aren't looking at all the things they DON'T want to do - just the exact moves that they need to get up the route.

...

These are great real-life examples of focusing on successes over failures

And it'd be useful if we did the same with our careers, wouldn't it?

---

Trail: Preparation, Focus On Successes

TODO: image of wall of motivation

Notes:

One tool that can help you focus on successes instead of failures

is a wall of motivation.

---

Trail: Preparation, Focus On Successes

# Self-handicapping

Notes:

As a word of caution...

If we spend our time focusing on failures, instead of successes,

we can end up self-handicapping.

This is when we avoid effort to keep failure from hurting us.
