# Maximize Professional Growth By Doing Scary Things

## Abstract

If it wasn’t for fear, we’d all have been eaten by saber-toothed tigers when we wandered too far from our caves.

But fear has lost its value. Fear now spends less time saving our lives, and more time preventing us from realizing our goals. In this session, we’ll ask some questions about the nature of fear. What do we fear? Why do we fear it? Are there benefits to fear?

We’ll then look in unusual places - the outdoors, the gym, the comedy club - in search of strategies for overcoming fear. We’ll talk about how doing things that scare you leads to incredible personal growth.

You’ll leave this session ready to stare fear in the eyes, and take control of your career.
